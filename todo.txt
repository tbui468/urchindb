Implement key/value database

    Index Record:
        uint32_t next_off
        uint32_t data_off
        uint32_t data_size
        uint32_t key_size
        char* key

    Data Record
        char* data

    Make github repo for this 

    Multiprocesser db - make it work with unix flock first
        How to test? Run two programs that continuously overwrite the same record with different data
        eg, one program writes ones and the other writes zeros.   Loop it a hundred times and see
        if data is valid (it should all be ones or zeros).  A

    Make locking compatible with Windows - will need to create new abstraction
    B+ tree instead of hash table
    Make it a distributed database - need to add network support
        how to keep all databases consistent?  !!!consensus!!!
        Should all instances have the same internal format, or just the same keys/values?
        Would also need to timestamp stuff
